# Edmundo Miranda - Portfolio
## About me

I'm Edmundo. I am currently majoring in Applied Economics at Universidad Centroamericana, where I have been able to learn many techniques for data analysis and statistical modelling. Now, after months of taking Python courses, I finally decided to start my own public portfolio for Data Analysis/Data Science.

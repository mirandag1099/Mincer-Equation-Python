# Mincer-Equation-Python
Mincer Equation using OLS method.

After months of taking courses to learn Python, I finally decided to start my own project for data analysis/data science.

In here, I attempt to confirm if a person's monthly income can be predicted using their years of schooling and experience (also known as Mincer equation in Labour Economics) using the OLS method. Also, I include the categorical variable "gender" as a dummy [1=woman, 0=man] for two main reasons: a) to determine if there's a statistically significant difference between average income for men and women; b) to have it interacting with the variable "education" in order to prove if there are differences between an additional year of schooling for men vs women. 

Even though this is a simple approach to the Mincer equation (starting by assuming that returns on education are linear, i.e., one additional year of high school yields the same returns as one additional year of college), I am confident that it can be very powerful in determining both the returns on educations, and the differences on income -if there any- between men and women.
